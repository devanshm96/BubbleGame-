# BubbleGame-
Inspired from [Sheryians Coding School Yt Channel] (https://www.youtube.com/@thesheryianscodingschool). I have implemented game logic, random hit targets, score tracking and game over conditions for an enhanced player experience. The score increases everytime you click the bubble whose number is equal to 'hit'.
